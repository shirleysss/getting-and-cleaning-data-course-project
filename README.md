# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Project Description 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## This repository contains:
- **README.md**: the description of the project
- **run_analysis.R**: the R script that was used to create the data set.
- **CodeBook.md**: the description of the contents of the data set.
- **Tidy_Data.txt**: the tidy data set.

## Steps to create the tidy data set
Using the R script run_analysis.R to create the tidy data set
- Download and unzip the source dataset if it doesn't exist.
- Read the dataset.
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each.
- Output the tidy data set.
